Security Considerations
=======================

* Do you have any external interfaces other than RESTCONF?

  * BIER project needs to get topology information via BGP-LS and BIER configuration via NETCONF.

* Other security issues?

  * The required security issues are provided in the RESTCONF, NETCONF and BGP-LS projects.

Quality Assurance
=================

* `Link to Sonar Report <https://sonar.opendaylight.org/dashboard?id=org.opendaylight.bier%3Abier>`_ 69.5%
* `Link to CSIT Jobs <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/bier/job/bier-csit-1node-basic-all-oxygen/>`_
* Testing methodology. How extensive was it? What should be expected to work?
  What has not been tested as much?
* There are unit tests and integration test available under folder "test" and system test in CSIT but the NETCONF
  interface is not tested and will be completed in next release.
