This is a checklist of actions that need to happen to the docs project when
cutting a new stable/branch after a release.

* conf.py: Update projects intersphinx mapping latest -> stable/branch
* conf.py: Update odl-{branch} intersphinx mapping add next release
* conf.yaml: Update version for next release
